# Spin wave expansion and simulation of extended XY-model

Code used for simulations in ...

The main idea is to simulate XY-like Hamiltonians undergoing a quench from a staggered magnetic field into a symmetry-broken phase.

The tool used is a Holstein-Primakoff transformation with different levels of spin-waves expansions depending on the task.
